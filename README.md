# landing-page
In The odin project course, I had to create a web page using only html and css elements learned so far.
With the help of this project I managed to solidify my knowledge in HMTL/CSS and especially my knowledge in using flexbox, a somewhat common element.
Besides, I try as much as possible to get used to the Git commands in order to perform some useful branches.
Below is an example of the page we had to recreate:

And this is my final result:
